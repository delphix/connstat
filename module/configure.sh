# The KCENTEVERS is the release up to the minor version treated as a floating
# point number multiplied by 100 (e.g for KVERS=4.18.0-1006-aws, KCENTEVERS=418).
# This is used in module/src/connstat.c to preprocess the code for different kernel
# versions.  The C pre-processor #if conditional statements need integers
